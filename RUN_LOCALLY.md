1. Find what's using port 3000:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000
   ```

2. Kill the process (replace PID with the number from step 1):
   ```bash
   kill -9 PID
   ```

3. Try `npm run dev` again

### If you see other errors
1. Make sure you're in the right directory:
   ```bash
   pwd
   # Should show: /Users/tone/cleared-advisory/cleared-advisory-nextjs
   ```

2. Try reinstalling dependencies:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the dev server again:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
